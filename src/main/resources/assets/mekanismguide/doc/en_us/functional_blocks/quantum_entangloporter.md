The Quantum Entangloporter is a configurable, shared buffer for Items, Fluids, Chemicals (e.g. Gas), and Heat.

Contents sent to one Quantum Entangloporter can be accessed by another on the same frequency. No power is required.

Due to the buffered nature, it is not recommended to send more than one variant per type on the same frequency unless you are certain it can be extracted before another will be inserted. E.g. Sending Lava through will be blocked until all the Water in the buffer is cleared.
