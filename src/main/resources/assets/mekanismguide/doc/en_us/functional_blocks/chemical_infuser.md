# Chemical Infuser
![chemical_infuser](item:mekanism:chemical_infuser)

The Chemical Infuser combines or reacts two gases to create another gas.

The gas gauges on the left and right side of its GUI are the input tanks, and correspond to correspond with the left and right sides of the machine.

The gauge in the middle is for the resulting gas, which likewise is output through the front of the machine.

These recipes do not require the gas to be in a certain tank (i.e. left/right tank doesn't matter).

Should you get the wrong gas into either of the tanks, you can use the Gauge Dropper to empty or transfer it.
