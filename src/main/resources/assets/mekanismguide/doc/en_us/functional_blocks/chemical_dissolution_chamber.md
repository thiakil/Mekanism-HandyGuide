# Chemical Dissolution Chamber

The Chemical Dissolution Chamber turns raw ores into slurry using Sulfuric Acid. This is part of the 5x ore multiplication pipeline.

This slurry then needs washing in the [Chemical Washer](../functional_blocks/chemical_washer.md).

In older versions of Mekanism, this machine had fixed input & output sides - this is no longer the case.
