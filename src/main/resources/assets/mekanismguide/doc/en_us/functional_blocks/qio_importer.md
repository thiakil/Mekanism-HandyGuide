# QIO Importer
![qio_importer](item:mekanism:qio_importer)

Pulls items from an inventory (chest/machine/etc.) into the QIO system. Once activated will show the colour of your QIO system.

Can be used with or without filters. Filters are the same as the [Logistical Sorter](../functional_blocks/logistical_sorter.md) minus colours.
