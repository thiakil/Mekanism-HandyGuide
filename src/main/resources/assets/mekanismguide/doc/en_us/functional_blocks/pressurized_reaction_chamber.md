![pressurized_reaction_chamber](item:mekanism:pressurized_reaction_chamber)

The Pressurized Reaction Chamber (PRC) is used primarily to create Substrate (to create HDPE Pellets), HDPE Pellets (to create HDPE Sheets), and Ethylene (an efficient source of fuel used in the Gas-Burning Generator).

It has a variable speed and energy usage dependent on the materials/gasses it is creating.

The PRC can accept a Liquid input, a Gas input and an Item input while outputting an Item and a Liquid. You may need 5 sides available for automation!
