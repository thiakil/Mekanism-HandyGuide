The Rotary Condensentrator (pronounced "con-DEN-sen-tray-tor") is used for converting substances between liquid and gaseous forms at a rate of 1:1.

It has two modes: Decondensentrating, which turns Liquids into Gases, and Condensentrating, which turns Gases into Liquids. Press the T button in the GUI to switch between modes.
