# Oredictionificator
![oredictionificator](item:mekanism:oredictionificator)

Named after the old Ore Dictionary feature, this block allows conversion between equivalent items/block between mods.

For example, Mekanism Tin Ore to another mod's Tin Ore.

Generally this process shouldn't be necessary, but sometimes a specific variant is required (or desired).

Open the GUI to configure which items/blocks to output, then either place the items in the slot or use pipes.
