# Radioactive Waste Barrel
![radioactive_waste_barrel](item:mekanism:radioactive_waste_barrel)

Allows one type of radioactive chemical to be stored in it. To check its constituents, "Sneak + Right Click" to it with both hands empty.

When radioactive chemicals are inserted, they will slowly decay (polonium and plutonium can't decay). The default decay rate is 0.05 mB/t, which is equal to 1 mB/sec.

Radioactive Waste Barrels can **NOT** be moved in any way. When broken, they will release their constituents to the environment, which will result in an irradiated area.
