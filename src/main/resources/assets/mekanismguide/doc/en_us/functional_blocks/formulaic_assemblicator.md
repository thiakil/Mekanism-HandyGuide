# Formulaic Assemblicator
![formulaic_assemblicator](item:mekanism:formulaic_assemblicator,mekanism:crafting_formula)

A machine that uses energy to rapidly craft items and blocks from Crafting Formulas.

With a crafting formula installed, the recipe is fixed. Can be used as a normal Crafting Table.

1. Place a Crafting Formula in the Crafting Formula Slot of the Formulaic Assemblicator.
2. Place the items for the recipe you wish to craft in the Crafting Grid, and then click the Encode Formula Button.
3. The Formula is now ready for use with the Formulaic Assemblicator.

## Buttons
### Encode Formula
Encodes the current crafting grid recipe to the Crafting Formula in the Formula slot (requires blank Formula).

To clear a formula, hold it in your hand and sneak-right click.

### Stock Control
Reserves a slot for each required item in the Formula, preventing the inventory from becoming too full of other items.

### Fill/Empty Grid
When a Crafting Formula is installed, fills the crafting grid from the internal inventory. Without a Formula, empties the crafting grid to the internal inventory.

### Craft Single Item
Just what it sounds like. Does not require power.

### Craft Available Items
Crafts as many items as possible from the available items in the inventory. Does not require power.

### Auto Mode
Continuously craft the Formula when items are available. Requires power.
