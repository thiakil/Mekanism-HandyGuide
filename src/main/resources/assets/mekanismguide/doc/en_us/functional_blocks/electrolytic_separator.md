# Electrolytic Separator
![electrolytic_separator](item:mekanism:electrolytic_separator)

The Electrolytic Separator performs electrolysis on fluids to create some very useful gases from some rather ordinary fluids.

The Electrolytic Separator requires a constant supply of power and must have a source of a suitable liquid in order to produce the gases.

As the liquid is electrolyzed, the component gases will be stored in its internal tanks - should either tank fill completely, the Separator will turn off.

If you are only using a single gas, selecting "dumping" or "dumping excess" for the unused gas will vent it to the environment, preventing that internal tank from filling completely and stopping processing.

Please note that while the Electrolytic Separator does take Energy Upgrades, they don't affect the machine's energy _efficiency_ (no, you can't break thermodynamics).

Burning the Hydrogen from Water in the Gas Burning Generator will produce the exact same amount of energy used to Electrolyse the Water. To achieve energy gain, Ethylene or other fuels must be used.
