![](item:mekanism:qio_dashboard,mekanism:qio_drive_array,mekanism:qio_importer,mekanism:qio_exporter,mekanism:qio_redstone_adapter)

QIO is a way of storing large amounts of items that can be stored, searched, and accessed remotely in late game. No power is required for system operation.

It comprises at least one QIO Drive (to store items), a [QIO Drive Array](qio_drive_array.md) (to hold the QIO Drives), and at least one [QIO Dashboard](qio_dashboard.md) (to access items in the QIO Drive Array).

Also available are the [Importer](qio_importer.md), [Exporter](qio_exporter.md), [Redstone Adapter](qio_redstone_adapter.md) and [Portable QIO Dashboard](../gear/portable_qio_dashboard.md).

Components must be set to the same frequency to work together. Click the Frequency tab on the upper left of the GUIs to access the configuration.

QIO Frequencies can be private, protected, or public, just like Entangloporters and Teleporters.

Please note that the individual blocks have a security setting as well as the frequency itself. This means that you can allow Trusted users to access your Dashboard configured for your private Frequency.
