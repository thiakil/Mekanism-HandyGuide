# Chemical Washer
![chemical_washer](item:mekanism:chemical_washer)

The Chemical Washer turns Slurry into Clean Slurry using Water.

The clean slurry then needs to be further refined by pumping it into a Chemical Crystallizer.

Note that unlike most Mekanism machines this one has fixed "in" and "out" sides for the mineral flow. "In" will be on the left when first placed and "out" is on the right.

Water is piped in through the top of the machine.
