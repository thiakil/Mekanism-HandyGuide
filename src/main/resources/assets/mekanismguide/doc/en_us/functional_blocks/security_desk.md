The Security Desk allows you to control the accessibility of your machines by other players.

You can add players to the "Trusted Players" list and use "Trusted" mode in your machines to specify who can access to your machines.

You can also choose which security mode you want to use by default. Change the security mode in the Security Desk. If you want to apply the newly selected security mode to the machines/tanks you placed before the mode was changed, click the "Security Override" button. It will automatically change the security mode of all of your machines.

The Security Desk also allows you to take and remove the ownerships of your machines. The top right slot removes your ownership from your machine meanwhile the bottom right slot gives the ownership of the machine that has **NO OWNER** to you. This also automatically sets the security mode of your machine to the mode you selected.
