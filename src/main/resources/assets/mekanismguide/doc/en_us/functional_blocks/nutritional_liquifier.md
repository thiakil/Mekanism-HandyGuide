The Nutritional Liquifier turns consumable food items into Nutritional Paste.

It can hold a total of 10000mB of paste before it is full and halts production.

The nutritional paste is used by the MekaSuit Helmet and the Canteen for feeding the player without having to carry physical individual food items in their inventory.
