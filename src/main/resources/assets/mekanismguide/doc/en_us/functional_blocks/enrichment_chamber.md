This machine uses energy to extract dusts out of certain blocks and ores, making it essential to producing different kinds of tools. Not to be mistaken with the Crusher, this machine is the pulverizer equivalent in other mods.

It can also perform other enriching tasks, such as turning Coal, Charcoal, Redstone, and Obsidian (dust) into their compressed variants.
