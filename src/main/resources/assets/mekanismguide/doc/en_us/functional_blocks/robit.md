Robit is Mekanism's mechanical companion. He can act as a crafting grid, a furnace, an anvil, a chest, or simply a cute little buddy.

To bring your Robit into the world, they must be placed onto a powered Chargepad. This will serve as their home location (which they can teleport to) as well as providing them a way to recharge their battery.

Various options can be toggled in your Robit's GUI - Robit's name, follow mode, pickup dropped items, teleport home (Robit only, you cannot come for a ride), change appearance.

Robit also has a small inventory, a 9x9 crafting grid, a small smelter, and an Anvil.
