# Factories
Factories are advanced forms of the basic machines aimed to assist in large scale resource processing. They come in 4 tiers: Basic, Advanced, Elite, and Ultimate.

Factories can perform multiple processes simultaneously, and can also auto-balance the inputs among the available process slots (toggled by the Auto Sort option). Power usage increases for each simultaneous operation.

A machine or factory can be upgraded in a crafting grid or by using Tier Installers.

## Tier Installers

To apply the Tier Installers, "Sneak + Right Click" to the machine with the Installer in your hand. 

Note that it is not possible to skip a tier or otherwise combine Installers to fully upgrade a machine.
