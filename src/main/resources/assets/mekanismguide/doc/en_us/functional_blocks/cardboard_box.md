# Cardboard Box
![cardboard_box](item:mekanism:cardboard_box)

The Cardboard Box can store a block with all its data and move it to somewhere else.

Some blocks can't be carried with the Cardboard Box as they are blacklisted by default.

To use it, right click to a block with the Cardboard Box in your hand. The block you were looking at will now be stored in the Cardboard Box. Now you can break the Cardboard Box and carry it in your inventory with the block stored in it. After placing the box on anywhere, "Sneak + Right Click" to the box with empty hand to extract the block and get your cardboard box back.
