# QIO Exporter
![qio_exporter](item:mekanism:qio_exporter)

The opposite of the importer, extracts items from the QIO system and inserts them elsewhere. Once activated will show the colour of your QIO system.

The exported can export into Logistical Transporters.

Can be used with or without filters. Filters are the same as the [Logistical Sorter](../functional_blocks/logistical_sorter.md) minus colours.
