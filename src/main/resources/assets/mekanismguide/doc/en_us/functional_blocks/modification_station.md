# Modification Station
![modification_station](item:mekanism:modification_station)

The Modification Station is used for applying modular upgrades to the MekaSuit and the Meka-Tool in exchange for energy.

A part of the MekaSuit or the Meka-Tool is inserted into the station along with the upgrade, resulting in the upgrade being applied (if compatible).

It functions similarly to an Anvil or a Power Armor Tinker Table from the Modular Powersuits mod.
