# QIO Redstone Adapter
![qio_redstone_adapter](item:mekanism:qio_redstone_adapter)

Allows emitting a redstone signal when a configured item has reached a specified count (or greater) in the QIO system.

After configuring a frequency, place an item into the configuration slot (will not be consumed), set a count in the text field and click the tick. Click the Fuzzy Mode button if you want to ignore NBT of the item.

The adapter will now output a redstone signal when the system has at least this amount of items matching the filter.

Combine this with a redstone control setting on a machine, and you can halt automated production when you have enough!
