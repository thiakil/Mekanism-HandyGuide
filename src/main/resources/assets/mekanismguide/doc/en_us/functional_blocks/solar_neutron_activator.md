The Solar Neutron Activator is a machine that directs the neutron radiation of the sun into its internal reservoir, allowing for the slow creation of various isotopes.

The input is at the bottom, the output is at the front. It does not need energy except for direct sunlight. There must be no blocks between it and the sky.

Solar Neutron Activators work faster in colder places and slower in hotter places. When placed in cold biomes and at very high altitudes, they will work most efficiently.
