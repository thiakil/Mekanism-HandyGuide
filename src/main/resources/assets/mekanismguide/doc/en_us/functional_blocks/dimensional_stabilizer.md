# Dimensional Stabilizer
![dimensional_stabilizer](item:mekanism:dimensional_stabilizer)

A machine that prevents areas of the world from disappearing when not observed (a chunkloader).

In exchange for power, keeps a configured area loaded when a player is not around (max 5x5 chunks).

Note that energy upgrades installed to the dimensional stabilizer will **NOT** reduce the energy usage; it will only make its energy buffer larger to be able to chunkload a larger area.

In the GUI, the area can be configured. Note that it is relative to North, but you can use the Show Visuals button to check in-world.
