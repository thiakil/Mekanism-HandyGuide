# Dictionary
![](item:mekanism:dictionary)
The Dictionary is a gadget capable of showing the tags of a block/item. Right clicking to a block with the dictionary in your hand will show all the tags that the block has. You can also sneak + right click with the dictionary in your hand to open its GUI. It has a slot that accepts items, you can put anything on the slot to learn about the tags of your item. If nothing appears, that means your item has no usable tags. Note that the tags mentioned here are not NBT tags, they are tags related to Forge and mods.
