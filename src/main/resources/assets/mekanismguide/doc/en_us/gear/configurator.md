# Configurator
![](item:mekanism:configurator)
The configurator is a tool that has several functions for Mekanism blocks. It has 11 modes in total.

First 8 modes work the same way but for different types. Select one of the first 8 modes and look at a machine's side and "Sneak + Right Click" with the configurator to change the side mode. Note that not every machine might support all modes of the configurator.


1. Configurate (Items): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "items".
2. Configurate (Fluid): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "fluid".
3. Configurate (Gases): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "gasses".
4. Configurate (Infuse Types): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "infuse types".
5. Configurate (Pigments): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "pigments".
6. Configurate (Slurries): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "slurries".
7. Configurate (Energy): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "energy".
8. Configurate (Heat): This mode allows the configurator to configure the side config of a machine for "heat".
9. Empty: This mode can empty items out of certain Mekanism inventories by sneak right clicking to them, such as factories and bins.
10. Rotate: This mode allows you to rotate rotatable blocks. "Right clicking" to a block makes its front side face at you, "Sneak + Right Clicking" makes its back side face at you.
11. Wrench: This mode allows you to break Mekanism blocks instantly by "shift + right clicking" on them. It also can break some blocks from other mods too. Make sure your offhand is empty for the wrench mode to work. Additionally, just "right clicking" to a Mekanism block with this mode makes the block rotate clockwise (if applicable).
