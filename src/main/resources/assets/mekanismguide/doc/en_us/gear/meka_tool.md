# Meka-Tool
![meka_tool](item:mekanism:meka_tool)

The Meka-Tool is a tool that is capable of doing things most tools do in the game!

**Important:** Even though a configurator is used in the crafting of Meka-Tool, it does **NOT** have the abilities that a configurator has.

Modules can be installed to the Meka-Tool via a [modification station](../functional_blocks/modification_station.md). After installing modules, the modules can be tweaked with the "Module Tweaker". The default keybind is "\" on English keyboard. You can check and change the keybind in the game's settings.
