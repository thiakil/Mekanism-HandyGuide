![](item:mekanism:geiger_counter)
Geiger Counter is a gadget that shows how irradiated the environment is as well as showing how long it will take until all the radiation in the surrounding environment will decay. The timer always shows the decay time of the radiation source(s). The baseline (background) radiation is 99.99 nSv and is completely harmless.
