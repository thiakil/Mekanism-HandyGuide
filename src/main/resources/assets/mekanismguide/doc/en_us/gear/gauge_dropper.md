# Gauge Dropper
![](item:mekanism:gauge_dropper)
Gauge dropper is a tool that can fill/empty gauges of machine and clear the gauges. Gauges are the internal tanks of machines you see when you open their GUI. After opening the GUI of a machine that has any type of gauge, pick up the dropper from your inventory and hover with it over the gauge you want. Left clicking with the gauge dropper to a gauge makes the gauge dropper store the gauge's content. You can left click to the gauge again to insert the content back into the gauge. Another function of gauge dropper is voiding the contents of a gauge. After picking up the dropper, sneak + left click to the gauge you want to void the contents of. You can also void the contents of a filled gauge dropper by sneak + right clicking with it while not in a GUI.

Note that radioactive chemicals can't be carried with the gauge dropper. Additionally, if you try to void them, you will end up irradiating the area.
