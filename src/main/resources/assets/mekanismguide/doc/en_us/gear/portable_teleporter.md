# Portable Teleporter
![](item:mekanism:portable_teleporter)

The Portable Teleporter allows you to teleport to a Teleporter block with the specific frequency.

The Teleporter does not need to have a frame. If there are multiple Teleporters configured for the same frequency, the closest loaded destination will be selected.

See the [Teleporter](../multiblocks/teleporter.md) page for detailed information.
