# Configuration Card
![](item:mekanism:configuration_card)
Configuration card is one of the most useful items in Mekanism. It allows you to copy the data from a machine and paste it on another same type of machine. To do this, sneak + right click to the machine you want to copy the data from, then right click to the machine you want to paste the data to. Note that this only works between same machines. You can NOT paste the data of a metallurgic infuser to an energized smelter since they have different datas.
