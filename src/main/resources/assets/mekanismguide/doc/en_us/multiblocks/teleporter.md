# Teleporter
![](item:mekanism:teleporter,mekanism:teleporter_frame,mekanism:portable_teleporter)

Teleporters allow entities to be teleported from a point to a point. Teleporter structure has only one size, which is built by using 1 Teleporter block and 8 Teleporter Frames shaped in a 3x4 vertical rectangle, leaving the 1x2 area empty inside.

Teleporters use frequencies to be linked to each other. When the same frequency is provided to 2 different Teleporter structures, the colored portal (you can choose the color however you want) will appear inside them. Although Teleporters require some energy to teleport the entities that go through them.

It is important to keep the chunk's of the Teleporter structures loaded to make them work properly. This can be done by either installing Anchor Upgrades to Teleporter blocks or using another type of chunk loading method (such as Dimensional Stabilizers).

If there are more than 2 Teleporter structures that share the same frequency, going through one will teleport you to the closest one.

Teleporter structures can work interdimensionally when there is enough energy provided to them.

Portable Teleporters allow you to teleport to the closest Teleporter structure that you selected the frequency of. Portable Teleporters only require for a Teleporter block to be present, meaning the structure doesn't have to contain a frame for a Portable Teleporter to teleport to it.
