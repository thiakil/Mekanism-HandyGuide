# Dynamic Tank
![](item:mekanism:dynamic_tank,mekanism:dynamic_valve,mekanism:structural_glass)

The Dynamic Tank is a multiblock structure that allows you store large quantities of one type of fluid or gas (it can't store radioactive chemicals!).

Dynamic Tanks can be built in any size between 3 and 18 blocks for any axis. The frame of the structure can be built ONLY with Dynamic Tank blocks. You can use any of the other 3 blocks while building the faces of the structure.

When the Dynamic Tank is empty, it will show the max capacity for gasses. Inserting any fluid to the Tank will adjust the max capacity value for fluids (since fluids can't be compressed unlike gasses).

To insert fluids/gasses, connect the corresponding transmitter to a Dynamic Valve. To extract the constituents, connect the corresponding transmitter to a Valve and set the transmitter to "Pull Mode" via a Configurator. Note that the Configurator must be set to any "configuration" mode in order to set the transmitter to "Pull Mode".
