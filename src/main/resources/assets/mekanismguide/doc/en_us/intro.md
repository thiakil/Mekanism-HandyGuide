## Introduction
Mekanism is an independent tech mod that brings many different machinery types to Minecraft,
solving problems nobody knew they had. The mod doesn't have any main goals, and you'll notice this when you see the seemingly random content Mekanism contains (from jetpacks to balloons). However, there is a somewhat linear progression system that is both easy to follow and increases in complexity as the player becomes
more accustomed to the mod, making sure that the player will have an easy time getting into the mod without ever getting bored with it.

By the time anybody has finished a mod pack using Mekanism, if they play a pack without it in the future, the first thought would be "Man, I wish I had Mekanism!". This seemingly simple mod has so much to offer to anybody willing to play, with minimal (but necessary grind) and ample rewards for the player's efforts.

Mekanism uses a tier-based system when organizing several of its core features (for instance: [Energy Cubes](functional_blocks/energy_cube.md) and [Factories](functional_blocks/factories.md)).

There are four tiers: basic (green), advanced (red), elite (cyan), and ultimate (purple), with each tier ordered respectively in increasing order in terms of energy consumption and processing slots.

Mekanism does not directly increase processing speed every tier, instead it adds extra processing slots which all process the inputted materials at the same time. Basic has 3 slots, advanced has 5 slots, elite has 7 slots, and ultimate has 9 slots.

By the time the player has got used to using Mekanism, they will have unlimited sand and gravel just from a cobblestone generator, will have a simplistic sorting systems for all of their items, will be obtaining five ingots for each ore they mine, and will be boasting their powerful, heavily equipped, and very protective Mekasuit alongside with their even more powerful Mekatool, which combines the power of Vein miners, Tree Fellers, Axes, Swords, Pickaxes, Shovels, and Hoes.

## Main Features

### Power Compatibility
Unless disabled in the configuration, Mekanism accepts power in and can convert to/from a number of energy formats: Mekanism Joules, Forge Energy, IC2 Energy Units (EU), and Flux Networks. NB: IC2 Classic is not actively supported.

### Ore Processing
Mekanism features an extremely advanced, extensive ore processing system. From simple machines used to process ores into ingots electronically, to complex chemical-based ore injection used to gain four ingots for every ore mined, Mekanism covers basic smelting, as well as 2x, 3x, and 4x duplication.
All machines have configurable input and eject sides, allowing you to have complete control over how you want to manage your machinery.

### Factories
Mekanism introduces the concept of "[factories](functional_blocks/factories.md)", which are multi-operation machines that can process multiple stacks of ores simultaneously. In a single machine, you can be smelting several stacks of ore into ingots, enriching several stacks of ores into dusts, or crushing several stacks of cobblestone into gravel.

### Ores
Mekanism is founded on the resource Osmium which generates pretty commonly at any Y level below 60. Osmium can be used to create tools and armor, but it is primarily used in the making of machinery.
Tin, Copper, Gold &amp; Bronze are also used in crafting recipes.

### Armor and Tools
Mekanism brings five new sets of armor and tools to the table, as well as the ever-famed Paxel (an all-in-one tool).

However, as Mekanism is a "tech mod," it has to have some cool techy gadgets. The Atomic Disassembler is an expensive, electronic multi-tool that can be set to mine at different speeds. Can't forget the Jetpack and Scuba Mask/Tank combination.

### Robit
The Robit is a cute little electronic robot that will follow you around and collect item drops for you. He also serves as a portable furnace, workbench, anvil, chest, and spirit lifter.

### Mining
Mekanism introduces the "Digital Miner" - an automated mining machine that can sort through terrain and pick out the resources you specify. It uses a filter-based system, and will then go through the range you specify and mine the blocks it needs to.

### Dynamic Tanks
These are multiblock tanks that can be shaped as any rectangular prism (capping at 18x18x18).

### Transmitters (AKA pipes)
Mekanism features multiple ways of transmitting items, fluids, gasses, heat and energy from once place to another, using devices we call "transmitters."

### Quantum Item Orchestration (QIO)
QIO is a way of storing large amounts of items that can be stored, searched, and accessed remotely in late game.
